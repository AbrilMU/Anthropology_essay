How the Pandemic and technology will reshape school and education forever. 

 Introduction
 This semester I learned something new about schools. I learned that schools are not only places where we send our children to learn and socialize, schools are vital to keep our society functioning and to maintain the mainstream dominant culture. According to Halloran, school educational goals are to produce citizens as functioning members of our society, by implanting and teaching a set of shared cultural values and preparing them for the job market. Schools are so much more than places where children learn academic skills, schools are found in large-scale industrial societies and are typically organized as states, which are hierarchical political systems with identified leaders and bureaucracies that oversee the operation of the political and economic system. Schools are part of those bureaucracies, as they are state-organized and regulated institutions of intentional instruction, usually provided on a mass scale with hundreds to thousands of students (Halloran,2021).
